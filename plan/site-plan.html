			<h2>Overview</h2>
			<h3>Purpose</h3>
			<p>Aviation Lovers is a platform dedicated to sharing detailed information about commercial and historical aircraft, including their specifications, history, and unique features. It allows users to explore a comprehensive database, compare different planes, and engage with a passionate aviation community.</p>
			<!-- change this -->

			<h3>Audience</h3>
			<p>This website is designed for aviation enthusiasts, students, researchers, and hobbyists who want accurate and engaging content about aircraft.</p>
			<!-- change this -->

			<h3>Dynamic elements</h3>
			<p>I will use JavaScript to add dynamic elements to Aviation Lovers by enhancing user interaction and improving the browsing experience. Some key implementations include:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Interactive Search & Filters:</strong> JavaScript will enable users to search for aircraft models and filter them by manufacturer, type, or year using real-time filtering without needing to reload the page.</li>
                <li><strong>Image Carousels & Animations:</strong> JavaScript will power interactive image sliders showcasing aircraft from different angles, as well as smooth animations for transitions between sections.</li>
                <li><strong>User Contributions & Comments:</strong> I will implement JavaScript-powered forms that allow users to submit information about planes or leave comments, with real-time validation and feedback.</li>
            </ul>

			<h2>Branding</h2>
			<h3>Website Logo</h3>

			<h2>Style Guide</h2>

			<!-- ------------------------Steps 4-8------------------------------ -->

			<h3>Color Palette</h3>
			<!--  The colors you choose for a website are one of the most important decisions you will make. Follow the instructions on the activity in iLearn then return and replace the color codes below with the hex color codes (the 6 digit numbers that show at the bottom of each color) for the colors you have chosen below.  You should have at least 2 colors but do not have to fill in all 4 if you do not need them.  -->

			<!-- Copy and paste the URL to your finished palette below Make sure to paste it into both spots -->
			Palette URL:

			<h2>Content</h2>
			<h3>Home page</h3>
			<p>On the homepage of <em>Aviation Lovers</em>, I want to welcome fellow aviation enthusiasts with a stunning hero section featuring a high-quality aircraft image, my logo, and a compelling tagline. I'll introduce the website’s purpose with a brief overview and key stats, followed by a section showcasing featured aircraft or categories. A search bar with filters will make it easy to explore different planes, while interactive elements like an image carousel and animations will bring the site to life. To build a community, I'll include a space where users can submit aircraft details and join discussions. Finally, I'll keep everyone updated with the latest aviation news and wrap up with a footer linking to essential pages and social media. </p>
			<h3>Browse Aircraft</h3>
			<p>For the second page of Aviation Lovers, I’ll create a "Browse Aircraft" section where users can explore different planes with a search bar and filters for manufacturer, type, year, and country. The page will feature a grid or list view displaying aircraft with images, names, manufacturers, and short descriptions, along with a "View Details" button for more information. I’ll highlight popular or featured aircraft, add interactive elements like hover effects and sorting options, and include pagination or a "Load More" button for easy navigation. This page will make it simple and engaging for users to discover and learn about different planes. </p>
			<h2>Wireframes</h2>
			<p>
				Create two wireframes for your site. One for each page and list them
				here
			</p>

			<h3>Home</h3>
			<p>
				This page will welcome users to the site with a hero image, logo, and
                tagline. It will also include a brief overview of the site, featured
                aircraft, and a search bar for easy navigation.
			</p>

			<h3>Browse Aircraft</h3>
			<p>
				This page will allow users to search for and filter aircraft by type,
                manufacturer, and year. The wireframe shows a grid layout with images.
